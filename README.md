# bot_detector

This is an initial model of a non-human website access (bot) detector coded using Java.

The model uses 3 main patterns (Suspicious User Agent, Rapid Access and Lack of Static resource access) to flag accesses suspected of being non-human in nature.

To run this model, call the main method on the BotDetector class.

The output will be generated in a text file called botdetector-output.txt
